## Title: AI-Driven Automated Plant Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

Plant diseases present a profound challenge to global food security, leading to significant economic losses, particularly for small-scale farmers. With food demand escalating, traditional detection methods—typically manual, slow, and prone to human error—undermine timely interventions and the broader goals of sustainable agriculture.

This chapter introduces an innovative AI-driven system that automates plant disease detection with exceptional precision. By harnessing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and advanced image processing, the system identifies disease-affected regions on plant leaves with remarkable accuracy. A key innovation is the use of noise-reduction techniques, including the Rank Order Fuzzy (ROF) filter in conjunction with K-means clustering, which significantly improves image segmentation. Additionally, the conversion of leaf images to HSI color spaces enhances disease classification when processed by sophisticated machine learning classifiers.

Developed on the MATLAB platform, the system achieves an impressive segmentation accuracy, demonstrated by a Jaccard coefficient of 0.91. This high-performance model eliminates the need for labor-intensive inspections and enables early disease detection, paving the way for proactive, data-driven management in precision farming. By optimizing resource use and reducing crop losses, this research addresses both the economic and environmental impacts of plant diseases, offering a scalable solution for sustainable agricultural practices.
