## Title: AI-Driven Automated Plant Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

Plant diseases present a profound challenge to global food security, leading to significant economic losses, particularly for small-scale farmers. With food demand escalating, traditional detection methods—typically manual, slow, and prone to human error—undermine timely interventions and the broader goals of sustainable agriculture.

This chapter introduces an innovative AI-driven system that automates plant disease detection with exceptional precision. By harnessing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and advanced image processing, the system identifies disease-affected regions on plant leaves with remarkable accuracy. A key innovation is the use of noise-reduction techniques, including the Rank Order Fuzzy (ROF) filter in conjunction with K-means clustering, which significantly improves image segmentation. Additionally, the conversion of leaf images to HSI color spaces enhances disease classification when processed by sophisticated machine learning classifiers.
